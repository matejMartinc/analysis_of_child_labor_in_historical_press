**German dataset*

The training data for the German corpus consisted of a random selection of 10 longer “articles” from ANNO (https://anno.onb.ac.at/) with longer being defined as “a minimum of 1 paragraph” and random meaning that the “articles” had to be spread out over different decades and different locations (urban/regional; central/remote).

The German corpus consisted of 1000 articles from the NewsEye Austrian press corpus (https://www.newseye.eu/) and included “articles” from the Neue Freie Presse, Illustrierte Kronen Zeitung, Innsbrucker Nachrichten and Arbeiterzeitung. Since the NewsEye corpus does not contain article segmentation, “articles” in this case are sentence-based search results of the keyword “Kinderarbeit” (child labor). This means the results can be short, few-word sentences or longer articles, parts of advertisements or image descriptions.

*Selected Newspapers*
Neue Freie Presse: existed between 1864 and 1939, intended as global-reaching medium; political orientation: fundamentally liberal tendency

Illustrierte Kronen Zeitung: originally Österreichische Kronen Zeitung (1900-1905); existed between 1905 and 1941, intended as a paper who should reach „every Austrian”; political orientation: many changes from a popular entertainment magazine without specific political orientation into a newspaper increasingly supporting the Austria-Hungarian monarchy (including nationalistic and war-glorifying tone during WWI) and later by Nazi propaganda, and it served as the mouthpiece of the German Reich from 1938 onwards.

Innsbrucker Nachrichten: existed between 1854 and 1945, intended as a paper with news from Innsbruck and Tirol, but also containing other domestic and international news; political orientation: conservative, monarchist, and Christian-conservative newspaper that initially focused on local reporting but later shifted its focus to national politics, covering the Austrian Empire, then the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, and after 1938 increasingly taking a National Socialist stance; after 1938 it became the mouthpiece of the German Reich for the Gau Tirol-Vorarlberg.

Arbeiterzeitung: existed from 1889 to 1991, newspaper mainly intended for domestic news and news on social democratic issues; political orientation: social democratic, mouthpiece of the labor movement until it was prohibited by the Austro-fascist regime in 1934.
